## Introduction:
	
This game was designed for a project on a twelve week Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. The brief was to build a two player Javascript game that maintained a score log and was able to detect a winner on a set of winning parameters. Additionally, the game needed to be deployed online for anyone to access. 
	
##The Build: <br> 
HTML <br>
CSS <br>
Javascript<br> 
jQuery  <br>

The brief was to build a two player Javascript game that maintained a score log and was able to detect a winner on a set of winning parameters. Additionally, the game needed to be deployed online for anyone to access.

Brain Training 2.0 is an educational game for 2 players, designed to test both memory and concentration levels. The game is aimed at both adults and children. The player is shown 4 lists each containing 7 items. Each of the 4 lists will populate individually for 10 seconds, during this time the user should try to memorize all 7 items in the list. 

After 40 seconds all the lists will have been shown. A random generator function will then ask the player to recall the 7 items in one of the 4 lists. The player who remembers the most items is the winner!

I focused most of my time on the Javascript and jQuey, keeping the HTML and CSS simple due to time constraints. I used my own proprietary version of Pivotal Tracking to pre-plan execution of the project. I discovered throughout the project better ways of refactoring my code and will definitely take that learning experience to my next projects. 

### Further deliverables:
	a. Build out the difficulty levels, so user can progress through the game.
	b. Ability to collect badges as they go along which unlock different levels, hopefully help to cement stickiness. 
	c. Toggle option for single or multi-player. 
	d. Restyle the CSS to feel more modern enhancing user experience to capturing a wider audience. 
	e. Add responsive design element.
