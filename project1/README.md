General Assembly Project One December 2015

Why?
This game was designed for a project on a twelve week Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. The brief was to build a two player Javascript game that maintained a score log and was able to detect a winner on a set of winning parameters. Additionally, the game needed to be deployed online for anyone to access.

Technical Requirements: The game design uses individual HTML, CSS and Javascript files. jQuery has also been used for DOM manipulation.

Further deliverables:
a. Build out difficulty levels, so user can progress through the game. 
b. Ability to collect badges as they go along which unlock different levels, hopefully help to cement stickiness. 
c. Toggle option for single or multi-player.
d. Different CSS layout to enhance user experience.
