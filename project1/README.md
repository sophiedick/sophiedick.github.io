General Assembly Project One December 2015

**** Why? ****
This game was designed for a project on a twelve week Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. The brief was to build a two player Javascript game that maintained a score log and was able to detect a winner on a set of winning parameters. Additionally, the game needed to be deployed online for anyone to access.

Brain Training 2.0 is an educational game for 2 players, designed to test both memory and concentration levels. The player is shown 4 lists each containing 7 items. Each of the 4 lists will populate individually for 10 seconds, during this time the user should try to memorize all 7 items in the list. 

After 40 seconds all the lists will have been shown. A random generator function will then ask the player to recall the 7 items in ONE of the 4 lists. The player who remembers the most items is the winner!


***Technical Requirements ****
The game design uses individual HTML, CSS and Javascript files. jQuery has also been used for DOM manipulation.

*** Further deliverables ***

a. Build out difficulty levels, so user can progress through the game. 
b. Ability to collect badges as they go along which unlock different levels, hopefully help to cement stickiness. 
c. Toggle option for single or multi-player.
d. Different CSS layout to enhance user experience.
